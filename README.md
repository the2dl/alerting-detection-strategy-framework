# Detection Framework

## About This Repository
This is a modified version of the Palantir ADS Framework which can be found here [Palantir ADS Framework](https://github.com/palantir/alerting-detection-strategy-framework/).

This version is updated to reflect modifications I found to be useful in onboarding detections. Much of the work by the Palantir team is still utilized here, just some changes to some categories to be documented, and re-wording certain sections.
